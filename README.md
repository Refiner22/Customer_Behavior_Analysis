# Customer Behaviour Analytics Dashboard

End-to-End Data Analytics Project (Python | SQL | Power BI)

## Executive Summary

### This project demonstrates a full end-to-end data analytics workflow, replicating how analytics is applied in a corporate environment to support strategic business decision-making.

Using customer transaction and behavior data, the project translates raw datasets into actionable insights through structured data preparation, analytical querying, and executive-level visualization.


## A retail organization identified significant changes in customer purchasing behavior across demographics, product categories, and sales attributes. Leadership required deeper insight into:

Customer segmentation and loyalty patterns

Revenue and sales performance by category

The impact of subscription status on customer value

Behavioral drivers influencing purchasing decisions

The objective was to leverage data to inform marketing optimization, customer engagement, and product strategy.

## The responsibility was to deliver a comprehensive analytics solution that:

Cleans and structures raw consumer data for analysis

Simulates business transactions and customer interactions

Extracts insights related to customer segments, loyalty, and revenue drivers

Presents findings in a clear, interactive, and executive-friendly format


## The project was executed across three integrated analytical phases:

### 1. Data Preparation, Modeling & Exploratory Analysis (Python)

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Key actions included:

Data cleansing to address missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies

Standardization of data types and categorical variables

Feature engineering, including age group classification and subscription indicators

Exploratory data analysis to uncover initial trends in purchasing behavior and customer distribution

### 2. Data Analysis & Business Querying (SQL)

Tools: SQL

Key actions included:

Structuring data into relational tables to simulate transactional systems

Developing SQL queries to analyze:

Customer segmentation by demographics and subscription status

Revenue and sales performance across product categories

Behavioral differences between subscribed and non-subscribed customers

Validating Python-based insights through structured SQL analysis

### 3. Business Intelligence & Visualization (Power BI)

## Key Findings

Non-subscribed customers represent the largest customer base, while subscribed customers demonstrate stronger loyalty characteristics

Clothing emerged as the highest-performing category in both revenue and sales volume

Young Adult and Middle-Aged segments contribute the greatest share of total revenue

Purchasing behavior varies meaningfully across age groups and product categories

## Business Impact
